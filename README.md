# hello-world
First repository. 

Hi, I'm Cyber Cimone (@cybercimone everywhere). I love networking and cybersecurity! Inspired by National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I decided I wanted to work on a personal project surrounding physical security using Python 3.8. I also figured it would probably be a good idea to get used to using GitHub as I see it is something a lot of IT professionals use to learn and develop their skillsets. I look forward to sharing my project here. Don't be afraid to follow me on Twitter or Instagram or visit my website at cybercimone.com

x, Cyber Cimone
